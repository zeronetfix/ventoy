Install Windows From Ventoy (GNU GRUB Version 2.04)
If you have Windows files on an SSD/HDD that you are using to install Windows without a USB drive, and your PC supports UEFI, but you accidentally shut down your PC during the installation from the drive, and you don't have a USB drive but have a SIM card reader that supports memory cards, you can flash Ventoy using an Android phone to repair the installation.

Use These Commands One by One, but First Understand:

At the GRUB prompt, you need to use the following commands to locate your Windows installation and boot it.

GRUB Commands:

1. Load the GPT partition module:
nsmod part_gpt

2. Load the chainloader module:
insmod chain

3. Set the root partition (This assumes your Windows installation is on the first GPT partition, you may need to adjust this):
set root=(hd0,gpt1)

4. Chainload the Windows bootloader:
chainloader /efi/boot/bootx64.efi

5. Boot into Windows:
boot

Before Using the Commands, You Should Find Your Drive:

1. List the drives to check available partitions:
ls

2. Check each partition (e.g., (hd0,gpt1), (hd0,gpt2), etc.) and confirm the location of your Windows installation:
ls (hd0,gpt1)
ls (hd0,gpt2)

3. Once youâ€™ve identified the correct partition, use the `set root=(hd0,gpt1)` command for that partition, and then proceed with the chainloading command:
set root=(hd0,gpt1)
chainloader /efi/boot/bootx64.efi
boot

By following these steps, you should be able to boot into your Windows installation and resume or repair it without needing a USB drive.
